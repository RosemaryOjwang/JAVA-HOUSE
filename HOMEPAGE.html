    <h1><strong>OUR STORY</strong></h1>
    <p>Java House, commonly referred to as ‘Java’,opened its first store in 1999 at Adam’s Arcade in Nairobi. With the
      aim of introducing gourmet coffee drinking culture in Kenya, the first outlet was a coffee shop and later the
      brand evolved to an American diner style restaurant to its present-day status as a 3 -day part coffee-led, casual
      dining concept.</p>

    <p>Java House is now one of the leading coffee brands in Africa and has grown to have outlets in 14 cities across 3
      countries in East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda). It has also birthed two sister brands Planet Yoghurt, a
      healthy, tasty and fun frozen yoghurt store and 360 Degrees Pizza, a casual dining restaurant.</p>
